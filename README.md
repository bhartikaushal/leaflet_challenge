# leaflet_earthquake_challenge
In this project, I built a layered world map that picks live earthquake data from USGS and plots all earthquakes occurring at the time. The earthquake markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.

## Tools used:

1. Javascript
2. CSS
3. html
4. leaflet library
5. d3 library

##STEPS:
1. Review and select datasets from USGS GeoJSON Feed. Data updates every 5 minutes. Selected dataset that traces all earthquakes everyday.

2. Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

3. Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

4. Popups were added that provide additional information about the earthquake(place, magnitude, and depth) when its associated marker is clicked.

5. A legend was added that provides a color scale based on the earthquake's depth.
